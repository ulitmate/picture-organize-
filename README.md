# PictureOrganizerScript
Script will transfer all pictures from my camera to their appropriate directories. I can enter the name for the file I want created in a window pop up. If the file has already been created, it will just go further into the subdirectories.



**Name of File**: Type in a name in the tkinter window that pops up.

**Year_Current**: Current year

**Month**: Month the picture was created.

**Day**: Day the picture was created.

**Year**: Year the picture was created.



## It will store it in this format:

E:\\My Digital Camera Pictures\\[Year_Current] Pictures\\[Year] [Month]-[Day]-[Year] - [Name of File]\\[All Pictures Go Here]



## The pictures are copied and renamed in the following format:

[Year] - [Month] - [Day] - [Year] - [Name of File] - #[Picture Number] of [Total Number of Pictures].JPG



It will only grab and copy any extensions that are JPG.
